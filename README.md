## Overview

The `PLANT_DISEASES__MODEL2.ipynb` notebook provides an end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing data, training a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance in detecting plant diseases. This project aims to assist in the early detection of diseases in plants, thereby helping farmers and gardeners maintain healthy crops.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need to have the following software and packages installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow/keras

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-diseases-model.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd plant-diseases-model

Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the notebook.

Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook PLANT_DISEASES__MODEL2.ipynb

Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess the dataset
Define and compile the CNN model
Train the model on the training dataset
Evaluate the model on the validation dataset
Save the trained model and any relevant outputs (such as plots or metrics)
To run the notebook cells, follow these instructions:

Execute each cell sequentially by selecting the cell and clicking the "Run" button in the Jupyter toolbar or by pressing Shift + Enter.
Modify any parameters or configurations as necessary for your specific setup.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project should be mentioned here. Provide details on where it can be found, its structure, and any preprocessing steps required.

Example:

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be downloaded from Kaggle. It contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves categorized into different classes.

Model
The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Results
Provide a summary of the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any other relevant metrics. Include visualizations of the results if available.

Example:

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the validation set. The following confusion matrix and classification report provide more details on its performance:
